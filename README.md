# two_comp_demo
Demo of a two-compartment HH model

Installation: 
1. Clone the repository to your local machine. Open the anaconda prompt in the cloned directory and navigate to the 'env' folder (cd env).
2. Run 'conda env create -f tcm.yml'. This command will create a conda environment called 'tcm'.
3. To see if everything worked, run 'conda env list'. The environmemnt 'tcm' should be listed in the prompt. 
4. Run 'conda activate tcm' to activate the environment and then run 'spyder' to open the spyder IDE.

You can use spyder now to run the demo script. Enjoy experimenting :)
